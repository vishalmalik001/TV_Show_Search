## Introduction

The TV Show Search Website is a simple web application that allows users to search for TV shows by title. It uses the TVmaze API to fetch and display TV show information, including show images and names.

This project demonstrates how to build a responsive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and how to make asynchronous API requests using Axios.

## Features

- Search for TV shows by title.
- Display search results with show images and names.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
